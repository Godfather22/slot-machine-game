Lines played: 3
Bet per line: 10

[6, 6, 6, 1, 2] -> 40 * 10 = 400 won
[6, 6, 6, 1, 2] -> 40 * 10 = 400 won
[6, 6, 6, 1, 2] -> 40 * 10 = 400 won
------------------------------------
					Total: 1200 won

Gen array:
{0, 0, 0, 18, 9}

Note: In these cases the 6's "wildcardness"
doesn't "activate" because if it did,
the wins per line would be 20 * 10 = 200,
which is less than 40 * 10 = 400.
