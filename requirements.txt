Requirements

1. As a player, I want to be able to specify the number of lines I want to play,
and bet a certain amount on them.

Example

Given: 20 lines to be played with a bet of 5

When: A screen with the following numbers is generated:

1 1 0 1 5 
7 1 0 1 5 
4 7 1 7 0

Then: The resulting screen should be:

Line 3, Card 1 x4, win amount 100
Scatters 7 x3, win amount 500
Balance: 100500

and 600 should be added to the balance

2. As a developer, I want my program to be able to handle invalid user input,
by informing the user of his error and prompting him to try again, and to
log the information for me and other developers of the project.

Example

Given: A prompt for the user to input the lines he wants to play, and the amount he bets

When: User input for lines played and bet amount is: aa bb

Then: The user gets this message displayed:

Invalid input!
Balance: [balance]| Lines available: 1-[max_lines] | Bets per lines available: 1-[max_bets]
Please enter lines you want to play on and a bet per line:

The following message is logged:

Error: Invalid user input '[input]'
